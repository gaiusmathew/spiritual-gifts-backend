Spiritual Gifts Discovery Tool  
This online tool is designed to help you discover your God-given spiritual gifts. Please read each statement carefully and mark how true it is for you using the scale below:
•	5 – Very true of me
•	4 – Mostly true of me
•	3 – Sometimes true of me
•	2 – Rarely true of me
•	1 – Not true of me
